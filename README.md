# AI-Driven-Threat-Detection-System.

# Project Overview

The AI-Driven Threat Detection System is a cybersecurity project that leverages machine learning to detect and analyze potential threats in real-time. It provides an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, enabling users to monitor activity, visualize anomalies, and gain actionable insights for proactive defense against cyberattacks.

# Features
```
Real-time threat monitoring and visualization
Anomaly detection using machine learning models
Interactive Streamlit dashboard for easy analysis
Works with synthetic and real-world datasets
Scalable design for enterprise security integration
```
# Tech Stack
```
Programming Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit (for the dashboard)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook (for ML model development)
```
# Project Workflow
```
Data Preparation → Generated synthetic datasets & integrated real-world security data
Model Training → Applied machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection
Threat Detection → Classified suspicious activities & potential cyber threats
Visualization → Displayed detection results via Streamlit dashboard
Analysis → Enabled interactive monitoring & filtering of threat patterns
```
# Applications
```
Cybersecurity monitoring for enterprises

Intrusion detection & prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

Real-time anomaly detection in network traffic

Security analytics for proactive defense
```
